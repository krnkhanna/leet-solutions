## 1. Two Sums

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

[Solution][1]

## 2. Add Two Numbers

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

[Solution][3]

## 10. Regular Expression Matching

Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '\*'.
'.' Matches any single character.
'\*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

[Solution][10]

## 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

[Solution][21]

### 27. Remove Element

Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

[Solution][27]

### 35. Search Insert Position

Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
